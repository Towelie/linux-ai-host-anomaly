**AI-assisted Linux host triage using high-signal telemetry**

Modern attackers blend into normal system behavior, abuse legitimate tools, and rely on techniques that evade traditional signatures. Detection often fails not because indicators are absent, but because tools cannot explain why something matters or what to do next.

HostTriageAI combines deterministic, policy-driven detection with analyst-grade AI reasoning to transform raw Linux host telemetry into actionable incident response insight.

It is designed to support fast, defensible decisions during host-level triage.

---

## Design goals

- **High signal over completeness**  
  Focus on telemetry attackers depend on and struggle to fully hide.

- **Deterministic first, AI second**  
  Certain host states (e.g., interactive shells bound to sockets) are never normal and should not be left to probabilistic judgment.

- **Assume uncertainty**  
  The analyzer does not assume the host is benign or well-understood.

- **Baseline inferred, not pre-defined**  
  The AI infers likely baseline behavior from host context instead of relying on static allowlists.

- **Human-verifiable output**  
  Every finding includes evidence, reasoning, and concrete next steps suitable for IR notes.

## What is collected

### Execution and runtime
- Root-owned processes
- Long-lived processes
- Process command lines and arguments
- Process parent/child relationships

### Network
- Listening sockets
- Established connections
- Owning process
- File descriptor context
- Optional socket inode metadata (when available)

### File descriptor context (high-signal)
- /proc/<pid>/fd mappings
- Detection of stdin/stdout/stderr redirected to sockets
- Correlation between interactive file descriptors and network connections

### Persistence
- System crontab and cron directories
- User crontabs
- /etc/init.d scripts
- rc.local metadata (if present)

### Authentication and access
- Last successful login sessions
- Failed authentication attempts
- SSH login history
- Active sessions
- SSH daemon configuration (metadata)
- Authorized SSH key metadata

### Privilege
- UID 0 users
- Detection of recent sudoers changes and high-risk rules

### Artifacts
- Executable files in /tmp and /dev/shm
- Common attacker staging locations

## How this tool detects high-risk behavior

HostTriageAI uses deterministic IR gates for conditions that should not be left to AI interpretation, including:

- Shell or interpreter processes owning active network sockets
- Interactive file descriptors (fd 0/1/2) redirected to network sockets
- Unexpected listeners bound to non-loopback interfaces
- Shell-backed reverse or bind shells

These detections:

- Override benign assumptions
- Override AI uncertainty
- Force a high-confidence compromise verdict unless disproven

The AI is then used to:

- Explain attacker tradecraft
- Correlate secondary indicators
- Recommend concrete next investigative steps
- Surface likely persistence or follow-on risk

---

## MITRE ATT&CK mapping

When deterministic shell/network findings are present, HostTriageAI automatically maps them to relevant MITRE ATT&CK techniques to support reporting and escalation:

- T1059.004 — Command and Scripting Interpreter: Unix Shell
- T1095 — Non-Application Layer Protocol
- T1571 — Non-Standard Port (when applicable)

Mappings are conservative and evidence-driven.  
No ATT&CK mapping is emitted without a concrete behavioral basis.

## How to use this tool

HostTriageAI is intended to be run on-demand for point-in-time host assessment.

### 1. Run the collector on the target host

From the repository directory:

    bash collect.sh ./host_facts.json

This generates a single JSON snapshot containing all collected telemetry.

The collector:
- Does not modify system state
- Does not require systemd
- Is safe to run on live systems
- Intentionally limits output size

### 2. Run the analyzer locally

Once the facts file is generated:

    python3 analyze.py ./host_facts.json

You should redirect output to a file during investigations:

    python3 analyze.py ./host_facts.json > findings.json

### 3. Interpret the findings

Each finding includes:

- severity  
  How urgently this should be investigated

- category  
  (network, persistence, execution, privilege, lateral_movement, etc.)

- evidence  
  Raw telemetry that triggered the finding

- reasoning  
  Why this matters from an attacker tradecraft perspective

- recommended_next_step  
  Concrete commands or actions for responders

Findings are designed to be:
- Readable by humans
- Easy to paste into IR notes
- Actionable without additional tooling

## Intended use cases

### Incident response triage (single host)

- Rapid assessment during suspected compromise
- Identify:
  - Active reverse shells
  - Unexpected listeners
  - Suspicious long-lived processes
  - Persistence mechanisms
- Support contain / escalate decisions

Limitations:  
No memory analysis, no forensic timelines, no lateral movement attribution.

### Threat hunting (hypothesis-driven)

- Validate focused questions such as:
  - Is there an interactive shell with network access?
  - Is anything persisting that should not be?
  - Are temp directories used for execution?

### Suspicious host validation

- Cloud instances
- CI runners
- Jump boxes
- Ephemeral or purpose-built systems

### Post-alert enrichment

- Add host-level context to:
  - SIEM alerts
  - Firewall detections
  - Cloud security events

## Example high-severity finding (sanitized)
```json
{
  "overall_assessment": "likely_compromised",
  "confidence": 0.9,
  "context_summary": [
    "The host is running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS under WSL2 in a Windows-based environment.",
    "A local user is present and has an interactive shell running.",
    "There are numerous Python package files and development artifacts in temporary and user directories, indicating use for software development or data science.",
    "System packages and scheduled jobs (cron) appear typical for an Ubuntu system with routine updates and maintenance tasks.",
    "Service-related software such as container tooling, SSH, DNS, auditing, and logging services are installed, consistent with a development or test environment."
  ],
  "high_risk_indicators": [
    "Shell interpreter owns an established outbound TCP connection",
    "Outbound connection bound to interactive stdin/stdout file descriptors"
  ],
  "findings": [
    {
      "severity": "high",
      "category": "network",
      "evidence": "An established outbound TCP connection from a shell process (pid 1234, command 'sh -i') from local address 192.0.2.10:54321 to remote address 198.51.100.25:9003.",
      "reasoning": "A shell process with interactive input/output ('sh -i') maintaining an established outbound network connection is highly abnormal for a standard Linux host and is indicative of an active reverse shell or command-and-control (C2) channel. Such behavior is not expected during normal system operation. The connection uses the shell’s standard input/output file descriptors, demonstrating direct network interaction via the shell and strongly suggesting active compromise.",
      "recommended_next_step": "Immediate investigation and containment are recommended. Isolate the host from the network, identify the origin of the shell process, and assess for lateral movement or data exfiltration."
    },
    {
      "severity": "medium",
      "category": "persistence",
      "evidence": "A user-level cron job runs every two hours: '0 */2 * * * python3 /mnt/shared/example_task.py'.",
      "reasoning": "User cron jobs can be legitimate, but recurring scheduled execution of custom scripts can also be used for persistence. Given the presence of an active outbound shell connection, this cron job warrants review to confirm legitimacy and ensure it is not being abused for persistence or follow-on activity.",
      "recommended_next_step": "Review the contents of /mnt/shared/example_task.py for suspicious behavior or network activity and confirm the legitimacy of the cron job with the system owner."
    },
    {
      "severity": "low",
      "category": "filesystem",
      "evidence": "The world-writable temporary directory (/tmp) contains multiple Python package files and user artifacts.",
      "reasoning": "The presence of development artifacts and package files in /tmp is common in development or data science environments. No suspicious executables or unusual permission patterns were observed in temporary or memory-backed filesystems.",
      "recommended_next_step": "No immediate action required. Continue monitoring for new or unusual files, especially executables appearing in temporary directories."
    }
  ],
  "_ai_original": {
    "overall_assessment": "likely_compromised",

```
This class of finding should **override benign assumptions** and trigger immediate investigation.

## This tool is not

- A vulnerability scanner
- A compliance or policy tool
- An EDR replacement
- A fleet monitoring solution

HostTriageAI is intentionally narrow and focused.

## Philosophy

> Collect what attackers cannot easily hide.  
> Analyze for meaning, not volume.

HostTriageAI exists to help responders make better decisions faster, not to replace deep forensic workflows.
